Watching crops emerge from the soil, I learned that life mirrors the land—nurtured by patience, shaped by care, and rooted in quiet persistence. Over time, I’ve fused that connection with technology to advance sustainable agriculture:

                                    My journey with SoilNet began when I met my mentor Leonard Gleyzer, MSc in Applied Mathematics at Brown University, where I dove deep into the roots of neural networks – the mathematics, the operations, and the algorithms that breathe logic into learning.
                                </p>
                                <p>After grasping the essence of the Multi-Layer Perceptron – the simplest yet most profound architecture of neural networks, I began shaping an idea: using AI to classify soil textures. Leonard then guided me toward Convolutional Neural Networks, models crafted for images, and this marked the beginning of my Deep Learning journey.</p>

                                        Then, I customized a Convolutional Neural Network – what I proudly called the SoilNet model. After consulting Leonard for guidance on hyperparameter tuning, I refined its architecture until it reached a remarkable 99.46% accuracy, a testament to precision born from curiosity and iteration.

                                In 2023, I founded Resoil, a non-profit project driven by the desire to restore and improve agricultural land for Vietnamese farmers, while simultaneously igniting the fire of knowledge for students across Southeast Asia. It was the moment I realized that the Mathematical and Scientific knowledge which once fueled my personal passion could now become the energy to regenerate life itself.
